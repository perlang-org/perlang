In these pages, we try to describe both what Perlang _is_ and what it aims to _become_. We try to make the distinction betwen these clear, when relevant.

If you just want to jump straight into some examples so you can get a feeling of what it looks like, head straight to the [learn](../learn/quickstart/index.md) section.
