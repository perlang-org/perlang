# API documentation

This section contains the API documentation for the Perlang interpreter and standard library. The [Perlang.Stdlib](Perlang.Stdlib.html) folder is perhaps the folder of greatest interest if you are looking for something close to "end-user" documentation. The other namespaces document the interpreter internals; they are more targeted towards Perlang developers and other people interested in how things are working under the hood.
