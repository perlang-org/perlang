          # Once we have a compiler which is C# and C++ (transpiled from Perlang), we should be able to build the
          # compiler for these platforms, but getting rid of the "Linux-onliness" of the compiler really depends on
          # moving to an LLVM-based backend, so we don't need to shell-execute clang++-14 to compile the C++ code.
