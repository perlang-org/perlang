    # Technically, this part is very different from the other part which
    # rebuilds the website. The reason for doing this is two-fold:
    #
    # 1) We want to ensure that the examples work, with the current (master)
    #    version of Perlang. Executing the examples with the newly built
    #    interpreter is the easiest way to accomplish this.
    #
    # 2) We want to ensure that a release build of Perlang actually _works_
    #    and can run a Perlang script at all. There has been bugs (#199, I'm
    #    looking at you!) where the release builds have been so badly broken
    #    that _all_ scripts were broken. By specifically making a _release_
    #    build here (which is self-contained and R2R-enhanced), we can help
    #    prevent regressions in this area with very little extra work.
