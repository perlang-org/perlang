## [0.2.0] - 2022-06-11
- The second public release of Perlang. Most notable changes are the added support for `uint` and `ulong` data types, as well as increased test coverage for binary operators (`+`, `-`, `*` and so forth). As of this release, our test suite covers all supported (numeric) type combinations.

### Added
#### Data types
- Allow assignment from `int` to `double` [[#300][300]]
- Add support for `uint` data type [[#307][307]]
- Allow coercions from `long` to `double [[#336][336]]
- Add support for `ulong` data type [[#337][337]]

### Changed
- Refactor number parsing to use `*Literal` types [[#308][308]]
- Make operand type checks be compile-time errors [[#329][329]]

### Fixed
- Fix broken support for certain negative integer literals [[#302][302]]
- Support division between `float` and `int` [[#311][311]]
- Improved type combination support with binary operators [[#327][327]]
- Fix binary operator support for `int` + `long` [[#328][328]]

### Tests
- Greatly increased the test coverage in general. The number of tests increased from 537 tests in the previous release to 1586 tests in version 0.2.0.
- Improve coverage of binary operator type combinations [[#313][313]]

- Add full type coverage for `%` operator [[#324][324]]
- Add full type coverage for `<<` and `>>` operator [[#325][325]]
- Verify expected types in binary operator tests [[#326][326]]
- De-duplicate `ReservedKeywordsTests`; improve coverage to cover all reserved words [[#331][331]]
- Make `BinaryOperatorDataTests` faster [[#332][332]]
- Add test for ensuring binary operators support all primitive types [[#333][333]]
