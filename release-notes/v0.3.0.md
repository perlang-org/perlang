## [0.3.0] - 2023-02-26
- The third public release of Perlang. The most notable changes are the added support for the `float` data type, and that the system has been upgraded to .NET 7.
- The REPL is also noticeably nicer to use now, particularly for those of us used to bash/Emacs-like keybindings. [[#354][354]], [[#356][356]]
- API docs on the website was broken since the v0.2.0 release for unknown reasons. [[#344][344]] has more details.
- Based on community feedback, the project README was also slightly improved. [[#371][371]]

### Added
#### Data types
- Add support for `float` data type [[#353][353]]

#### General
- ~~Upgrade to .NET 7 RC1 [[#347][347]]~~, superseded by [[#351][351]]
- Upgrade `System.CommandLine` to 2.0.0-beta4.22272.1 [[#350][350]]
- Upgrade to .NET 7 RTM [[#351][351]]
- Add support for `string` and `IDictionary` indexing [[#363][363]]

### Changed
* Quote types names in error message emitted when attempting to reassign a variable to an incoercible type. [[#343][343]]
* Use `getline.cs` for line-editing in REPL [[#354][354]]
* Minor `getline.cs` improvements [[#356][356]]

#### Maintenance
- Bump Microsoft.CodeAnalysis from 2.6.0.0 to 4.4.0 [[#358][358]]
- Bump xunit.runner.visualstudio from 2.4.3 to 2.4.5 [[#359][359]]
- Bump Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk from 16.7.1 to 17.4.1 [[#362][362]]
- Bump FluentAssertions from 6.4.0 to 6.10.0 [[#365][365]]

### Fixed

### Tests
- Continued adding more tests for functionality being added to the system. The number of tests increased from 1586 tests in the previous release to 1921  tests in version 0.2.0. This is partly caused by [[#353][353]], which added support for the `float` data type. Each primitive data type supported requires a significant number of tests to be added for the "meta-tests" to complete; these ensure that no data types get added to the system without properly defined semantics for all operator/primitive type combinations.
