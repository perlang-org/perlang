## [0.5.0] - Unreleased
- The fifth public release of Perlang. This release is a major milestone for the project, as it marks the first release where interpreted mode and the REPL has been removed and the focus has shifted to compiled mode. The REPL was a nice feature to have, but it was not feasible to implement it in compiled mode at this time. As noted below, we hope to bring it back in the future, but with an LLVM-powered backend (emitting native code on-the-fly).
- All changes below were made by @perlun

### Breaking changes
- **The REPL has been removed**. While it was a nice feature to have, it is not currently possible to implement in compiled mode (until we start emitting code via LLVM or similar). The REPL is one of our favorite features, so we hope to bring it back in the future.
- The `-e` option has been removed. Similarly as above, this was a feature that was only available in interpreted mode which is now going away.
- Interpreted mode has been removed, and compiled mode is now the default. Some features are still not available in compiled mode; these will print an error or throw an exception if you attempt to use them.

### Added
#### Experimental compilation
- `BigInt::pow`: Detect negative exponents and throw an exception [[#450][450]]
- Implement initial native `ASCIIString` class [[#451][451]]

- Support more types in `string+int` and `int+string` concatenation [[#473][473]]
- Fix `ASCIIString`+`ASCIIString` concatenation to return `ASCIIString` [[#474][474]]
- Support `string+bigint` and `bigint+string` concatenation [[#475][475]]
- Support `string`+float/double and float/double+`string` concatenation [[#477][477]]
